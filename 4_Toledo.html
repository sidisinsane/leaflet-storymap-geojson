    <h4>SPENCER-SHARPLES SCHOOL DISTRICT</h4>
    <p id="summaryBox">Some cases, like that of Spencer-Sharples School District in Ohio, are especially stark examples of wealthy townships refusing to serve needy student populations, with unhappy results.</p>
    <p>The story of Spencer-Sharples School District in northern Ohio is an especially vivid illustration of the way district boundaries can be purposefully drawn to exclude.  The district was first formed in 1948 with the merger of Spencer and Harding Townships into one school system, which then occupied the area outlined in orange on this map.  Ten years later, citizens in both towns voted to split.  The intention was for Harding’s schools to become part of Swanton Local School District to the south and west, and for Spencer schools to join Springfield Local School District to the east.</p>  
    <p>In Harding, all went according to plan.  But Springfield’s board of elections voted to reject the influx of students from Spencer township, with its much larger proportion of low-income, African-American residents.  Spencer students were left in a smaller, poorer Spencer-Sharples school district. By 1968, the district was under-enrolled and underfunded, with no neighboring school district willing to join with it.  At the request of the Ohio state government, Toledo Public Schools, which lay on the other side of Springfield, agreed to annex Spencer-Sharples. But by 1980, district leadership decided it had become too costly and difficult to operate schools located in Spencer, isolated as they were from the rest of Toledo’s school system. Over the strong objections of many in the affected community, Toledo closed all schools formerly located in Spencer-Sharples and began to bus students through Springfield into western Toledo.  The busing arrangement remains in place today, with the children of Spencer crossing two district lines just to get to schools that will have them.</p>
