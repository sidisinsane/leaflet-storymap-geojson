    <h4>CAMDEN CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT</h4>
    <p id="summaryBox">Because property values are a large factor in the revenue raised for schools, affluent communities are incentivized to wall themselves off, leaving low-income students, like those in Camden, NJ, trapped in districts with very high concentrations of poverty.</p>
    <p>Camden City School District serves over 16,000 students, of whom 45% live in poverty and 90% are eligible for free- or reduced-price lunch. It is by far the poorest district in its region—in fact, according to Census data, Camden has the  <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/09/us_city_poverty_rankings_look_up_compare_nations_biggest_cities.html?appSession=11054983560492" target="_blank">highest poverty rate</a> of any city in the US (overtaking Detroit in 2013). Within five miles of Camden, there are 32 other school systems that all have more advantaged student populations.</p>
    <p>This profusion of districts leads to significant waste as administrative, maintenance, and construction costs are duplicated across dozens of jurisdictions.  A 2013 <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SchoolDistrictSize.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the Center for American Progress estimated that New Jersey's inordinate number of districts costs the state's schools about $100 million per year.</p>
    <p>More importantly, the end result of these many borders is that the children of Camden are fenced off from their more affluent peers—in effect, sacrificed to keep the poverty of the city from dragging down the property wealth of its neighbors. This kind of socioeconomic segregation intensifies the educational challenges posed by poverty and leads to poorer education, health, and economic outcomes for students.</p>
