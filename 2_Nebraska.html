    <h4>NEBRASKA'S ISLANDS</h4>
    <p id="summaryBox">Many district borders, like those in Nebraska, are left over from old systems and outdated neighborhood maps, slicing through communities in illogical ways.</p>
    <p>The state of Nebraska has 240 school districts, many of which are non-contiguous (like a chain of islands), with bits and pieces of one district scattered into the borders of another. This is the quirky legacy of a now-defunct solution to Nebraska’s sparse student population. Many school districts were once considered “Class I,” meaning that they had only elementary schools and their students were allowed to attend any county high school. When the state eliminated this category in 2006, individuals who owned land within former Class I districts chose which high schools their school system would affiliate with, often selecting schools that were located outside their district’s borders.</p>
    <p>The history of these isolated schools may be innocent, but the scatter they create on the district map is a perfect example of the ways in which antiquated borders can create illogical divisions within communities. Ansley Public Schools, with a student poverty rate just over 30%, has district islands scattered across four surrounding communities, all four of which are better-resourced, with an average poverty level below 17%.  Meanwhile, three districts have carved out bits of Ansley for themselves, while their student poverty rates are about half that of Ansley Public Schools.</p>
