    <h4 id="d">CONCENTRATED POVERTY</h4>
    <p id="summaryBox">The number of communities in concentrated poverty has doubled since the Great Recession, leaving more children completely removed from wealth and resources.  Our school funding system only increases this isolation.</p>
    <p>The poor children of Spencer and Camden are not outliers.  Today, there are 495 school districts (colored red on this map) whose student poverty rates exceed 40%—more than double the number there were before the Great Recession.  The children living in these neighborhoods of <a href="http://www.tcf.org/assets/downloads/Concentration_of_Poverty_in_the_New_Millennium.pdf" target="_blank">concentrated poverty</a> are not only living below the federal poverty line; they’re living in areas where need and disadvantage are all they ever see.</p> 
    <p>As poor neighborhoods multiply and become ever more isolated from better-off communities, schools have the potential to serve as a corrective, a way to bring students of different socioeconomic backgrounds together and to bring resources and opportunity into the lives of needy kids.  The school funding system we have, though, only draws brighter lines between the haves and have-nots.  Tying school finances to local property taxes incentivizes wealthy communities to wall themselves off, concentrating poverty in particular districts and creating school systems that have fewer resources to meet greater challenges.</p>
