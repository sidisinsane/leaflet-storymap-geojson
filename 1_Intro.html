    <h4>DIVIDING LINES</h4>
    <p id="summaryBox">Our current school funding system often bolsters school district boundaries between rich and poor, holding resources in wealthy communities and keeping low-income students from accessing broader opportunities.</p>
    <p>In June, The Supreme Court decided <i>Texas v. Inclusive Communities Project</i>, affirming that no government policy, even one without discriminatory intent, may create “artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers” for minority individuals and families seeking quality housing in a good neighborhood.  However, one kind of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barrier continues to separate families—often poor and minority families—from places of opportunity: school-district boundaries.</p>
    <p>In the United States, the public school a student attends is still primarily determined by where their family lives. Most children are enrolled in district schools that receive, on average, nearly half of their funding through local property taxes.  This system ties school budgets to the value of local property wealth and incentivizes boundaries between upper- and lower-income communities. Intentional or not, these invisible walls often concentrate education dollars within affluent school districts,  and ensure that low-income students are kept on the outside. </p>
    <p>This map, which shows <a href="http://edbuild.org/blog/2015/what-about-my-district" target="_blank">student poverty levels</a> within the more than 13,000 school districts in the United States, begins to paint a picture of this phenomenon: school districts drawn in odd shapes and sizes, many sitting next to—or even inside of—districts of wildly different means.  Click the <span style="color:#3990A3">NEXT</span> button above to see specific examples of how district boundaries can divide students from resources, split neighborhoods, and create communities that are anything but inclusive.</p>
